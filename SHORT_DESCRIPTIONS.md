```

## One-Liner (Tweet-length)
```
Build scalable multi-tenant SaaS on Kubernetes: namespace isolation + ArgoCD GitOps + Argo Rollouts canary deployments. Production-ready & minikube-friendly!
```

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```
A complete reference implementation showing how to build a multi-tenant SaaS platform 
on Kubernetes. Each customer runs isolated in their own namespace while sharing 
infrastructure. Uses ArgoCD for GitOps automation and Argo Rollouts for safe canary 
deployments. Includes everything: Helm charts, sample app, docs, and setup scripts.

**Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform on Kubernetes**

A production-ready platform demonstrating modern SaaS architecture with:
• Namespace-based tenant isolation
• GitOps continuous delivery via ArgoCD  
• Progressive deployments with Argo Rollouts
• Complete automation and observability

Perfect for learning SaaS patterns or building your own platform.
```

## Technical Summary
```
This project implements a multi-tenant SaaS architecture using Kubernetes primitives 
(namespaces, network policies, RBAC) combined with GitOps tooling (ArgoCD) and 
progressive delivery controllers (Argo Rollouts). Each tenant is isolated via namespace 
boundaries with dedicated resources, while Helm charts template the infrastructure for 
repeatable deployments. Includes sample Node.js application, monitoring setup, and 
comprehensive documentation.
```

## Value Proposition
```
Learn and implement multi-tenant SaaS architecture the right way: secure isolation, 
automated deployments, safe releases, and cost efficiency through resource sharing.
